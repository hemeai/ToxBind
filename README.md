## Introduction

This is a repository for the snake venom binder project using BindCraft. The project is based on the paper "De novo designed proteins neutralize lethal snake venom toxins" by the Baker lab (Awesome work). The paper describes the design of a protein that can neutralize snake venom toxins.

## TODO

- [ ] Combine all workflow into one
- [ ] Add target sequence, PBD ID of target sequence, Date and BindCraft version
- [ ] Add GCP backend also
